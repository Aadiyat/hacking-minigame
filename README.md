# Fallout Hacking Minigame
A React web app in the style of the terminal hacking minigame as seen in Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 4 and Fallout 76

## Background
I thought it would be fun challenge to exactly recreate the look and feel of an existing game, since I would have to adhere to existing functional and presentation requirements.

## Playing the Game
Play it here https://aadiyat.github.io/hacking-minigame/
